# CMA Junior  Developer Code Test

A 5-table SQLite database has been provided. The database contains a table of 100 artworks, a table of creators, a table of departments, and 2 linking tables containing the relationships between artworks, departments, and creators.

## Task

Using python, write a script that generates two separate json files that match the following criteria:

- All artworks in the "Chinese Art" Department
- All arworks that were accessed between the years 1940 and 1980. The first 4 numbers in the accession number for an artwork denotes the year in which the artwork was accessed into the Museum.

Your json artwork objects should have relevant information from the creators and departments table. Use the relationship tables for this.

## Completion and Submission

Completed work should include all code to arrive at the solution, plus all code, assets, and resources required to run the solution.

PLEASE INCLUDE a detailed README containing requirements and instructions for running the project locally.

All completed work should be pushed to a public repo on GitHub.
